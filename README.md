# Face Detection Android Application

This repository contains a comprehensive Android application that leverages various Google machine learning models for a range of tasks, including face detection, text detection, label detection, and object detection.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Identify and locate faces within images or video streams.
- **Text Detection**: Detect and recognize text within images.
- **Label Detection**: Assign labels to detected objects within images to classify them.
- **Object Detection**: Identify and locate multiple objects within images or video streams.
